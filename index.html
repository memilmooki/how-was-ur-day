    <p>
        The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling documents and other web
        resources to be accessed over the Internet.[1]

        Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by
        programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through
        character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs).
